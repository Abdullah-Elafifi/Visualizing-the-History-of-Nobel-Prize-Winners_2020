Explore a dataset containing a century's worth of Nobel Laureates. Who won? Who got snubbed?

<h2> I'm trying to answer these business questions: </h2>

<ul>
  <li>What is the most commonly awarded gender and birth country?</li>
  <li>Which decade had the highest ratio of US-born Nobel Prize winners to total winners in all categories?</li>
  <li>Which decade and Nobel Prize category combination had the highest proportion of female laureates?</li>
  <li>Who was the first woman to receive a Nobel Prize, and in what category?</li>
  <li>Which individuals or organizations have won more than one Nobel Prize throughout the years?</li>
</ul>
